I made packages and all exceptions are in one package, all users (Person and Customer classes) are in a package
and there is an MVC (model view controller) package.

I refactored Hotel, Room, SingleRoom and DoubleRoom classes, Added a LoginPage class that handles the uti
when a Customer wants to log in, a SignUpPage class that handles UI when customers want to sign up and a
TextFieldPanel class that is a Jpanel containing a textfield and a label describing what info should go 
in that textfield.

I added OverBookedException class covering the case when more than the allowed maximum number of customers
try to book a room, I also added an images folder that will contain pictures to be used in the UI.

I plan to make Person.gender to be an enum and to do more with the HotelController and HotelView classes, 
the plan is to make sure the UI works and looks good before adding everything together
